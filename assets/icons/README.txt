Place your site logo here as `logo.png` (PNG recommended).

Steps:
1. Add your image file named exactly `logo.png` into this folder.
2. The site already references the favicon and on-page logo at `assets/icons/logo.png`.
3. Recommended size: 256x256 or 512x512 for favicon; on-page logo is displayed at 36x36 CSS pixels and will be auto-scaled.

If you'd like, upload the `logo.png` and I can add it to the repo for you.
