React Portfolio scaffold

This folder contains a minimal Vite + React scaffold to start migrating the existing static portfolio into a React app.

Quick start (from this folder):

1. npm install
2. npm run dev

Notes and next steps:
- Copy assets (images, icons, css) into this folder's `public` or `assets` directory so they are served by Vite.
- Migrate each page (about, skills, projects, contact) into React components and routes (e.g., React Router).
- Optimize images and add production build steps.
- I created simple components (`Nav`, `Home`) as a starting point.

If you want, I can continue by migrating one of your existing pages into React components and wiring client-side routing next.
